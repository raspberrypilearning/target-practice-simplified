### Draw a target circle every frame

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> Computers create the effect of movement by showing lots of images one after another. Each image is called a <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;">frame</span>.  
</p>

Define your `shoot_arrow()` function under the comment `# The shoot_arrow function goes here`.

Add code to randomly draw a brown circle within a target area:

![A semi-transparent rectangle showing the target area, labelled with the coordinates. The target area is between x=100, y=100 and x=300, y=300. It covers the whole target and a bit of the space around it.](images/target_area.png)

def shoot_arrow():

    arrow_y = randint(100, 300)  # Store a random number between 100 and 300

    circle(arrow_x, arrow_y, 15)  # Draw a small circle at random coordinates

Go to the `draw()` function and call your new `shoot_arrow()` function.

language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 31
line_highlights: 33
---
    fill('yellow')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to yellow      
    circle(200, 200, 30)  # Draw the middle circle using x, y, width
    shoot_arrow()

**Test:** ðŸ”„ Run your code to see the arrow appear in a random position each frame.

title: Why can't I see all the arrows?
---

The background and target are drawn over the old arrow. This means you only see one arrow at a time.
