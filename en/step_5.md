## Fire your arrow

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
When you click or tap, an arrow will fire at the position of a moving target circle.

### Draw a target circle every frame

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> Computers create the effect of movement by showing lots of images one after another. Each image is called a <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> frame </span>.

Define your `shoot_arrow()` function under the comment **# The shoot_arrow function goes here**. 

Add code to randomly draw a brown circle within a target area:

Go to the `draw` function and call your new `shoot_arrow` function. 

--- code ---

language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 31
line_highlights: 33
---
    fill('yellow')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to yellow      
    circle(200, 200, 30)  # Draw the middle circle using x, y, width
    shoot_arrow()

**Test:** ðŸ”„ Run your code and see the arrow appear in a random position each frame.

The background and target will be drawn over the old arrow. This means you only see one arrow at a time.
