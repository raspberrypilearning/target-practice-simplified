### Draw a triangular stand
Your game needs a target to shoot arrows at.

--- task ---

Set the fill colour to `sienna` (brown). 

Draw a triangle using the x and y coordinates for each of the corners.

![A brown triangle on grass and against a sky. The corners of the triangle are labelled as x=150, y=350; x=200, y=150; and x=250, y=350. The corners of the canvas are also labelled as x=0, y=0 in the top left-hand corner and x=400, y=400 in the bottom right-hand corner.](images/stand_coords.png){:width="400px"}

### Draw the target circles

--- task ---

The largest part of the target is a blue **circle**.

Set the fill colour to `blue`. 

Draw a circle with x and y coordinates for its centre and a width.

![A blue circle over a brown triangle on grass and against a sky. The centre of the circle is labelled with the coordinates x=200, y=200 and the circle width is labelled as 170.](images/circle-coords.png){:width="400px"}

    fill('sienna')  # Brown colour
    triangle(150, 350, 200, 150, 250, 350)  # Draw a triangle for the target's stand 
    fill('blue')  # Set the circle fill colour to blue
    circle(200, 200, 170)  # Draw the outer circle
  
--- /code ---

**Test:** ðŸ”„ Run your code to see the first large blue circle. 

The blue circle was drawn after the stand, so it is in front.

The target is made of different-sized circles with the same coordinates for the centre (200, 200).

--- task ---

**Add** coloured circles for the inner and middle parts of the target.

    fill('sienna')  # Brown colour
    triangle(150, 350, 200, 150, 250, 350)  # Draw a triangle for the target's stand 
    fill('blue')  # Set the circle fill colour to blue
    circle(200, 200, 170)  # Draw the outer circle
    fill('red')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to red
    circle(200, 200, 110)  # Draw the inner circle using x, y, width
    fill('yellow')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to yellow      
    circle(200, 200, 30)  # Draw the middle circle using x, y, width

title: Change the colours in your project
---

To change any of the colours, use a different colour name. You can find a list of all of the available colour names on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp){:target="blank"}. 

![A target made up of yellow, pink, and purple circles on a red stand, on blue ground and against a purple sky.](images/alternative-colours.png){:width="400px"}

Example code using different colours:

    fill('FireBrick')
    triangle(150, 350, 200, 150, 250, 350)  # Stand
    fill('LemonChiffon')
    circle(200, 200, 170)  # Outer circle
    fill('DeepPink')
