## What next?

If you are following the [Introduction to Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/python-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rocket-launch) project. In this project, you will make an interactive animation of a rocket launching a satellite into orbit.

**Try it:** Your program will adjust the animation based on how much fuel you give it and will succeed or fail in reaching orbit. How much fuel do you want to use to reach orbit but not waste too much extra fuel? 

**Tip:** Around 25,000kg should be enough, but experiment with the numbers to see what happens.
